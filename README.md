# Glytch - Image Distortion


GLYTCH EFFECTS:
* SORT: Sort from lowest value to highest value. Sort by pixel or sort by RGB channels.
* SHUFFLE: Shuffle pixels or shuffle RGB channels.
* INVERT: Invert the color channels (R,G,B)
* BIT SHIFT: Shift the pixels by specified number of bits.
  - e.g., bit shift of 1 bit moves all bits one position to the right
* SMEAR: Smear pixels to the right. Each pixel affects the color of the preceding pixel, with decreasing intensity, determined by the specified length. The intensity determines how much a pixel affects the preceding pixels.
* REORDER: Reorder the color channels.
  - e.g., (R,G,B) -> (G,R,B)
* DRIFT: Pixel-sort


TODO:
- teal colors.
- want the panels aligned better.
